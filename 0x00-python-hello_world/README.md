# Python - Hello, World
***
This directory contains shell and Python scripts, and C programming language codes that help improve programming knowledge and understanding in the following ways;
***
* Writing a shell script that runs a Python script whose name is in environment variable **$PYFILE**.
***
* Writing a shell script that runs Python code stored as a string in an environment variable **$PYCODE**.
***
* Writing a Python script that prints ***"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle***.
***
* Completing a [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py) in order to print the integer stored in the variable **number**, followed by **Battery street** by using f-strings and not casting the variable **number** to a string.
***
* Completing the [souce code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py) in order to print the float stored in the variable **number** with precision of 2 digits without casting the varible and only using f-strings.
***
* Completing a [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py) in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable **str** without using loops or conditional statements.
***
* Completing the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py) to print ***Welcome to Holberton School!*** without using loops or conditional statements.
***
* Completing the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py) without using loops or conditional statements.
***
* Completing the [source code]() to print ***object-oriented programming with Python*** without using loops or conditional statements, without creating new variable, and without using string literals.
***
* Writing a Python script that prints **"The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters**.
***
* Writing a C function that checks for the presence of a cycle in singly linked list.
***
* Writing a Python script that prints exactly ***and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19*** to stderr by using the **write** function in the **sys** module, and exit code **1**.
***
* Writing a shell script that compiles a Python script file whose name is stored in environment variable **$PYFILE**, with output filename being **$PYFILEc**.
